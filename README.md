# Machine-Is-Faulty
Java OOP CA project 
  
Outline
• The purpose of the assignment is to build a GUI prediction tool that predicts an outcome, based on theme 
  you have been given. For example, if your theme was LoanApproval - the predictor will be about 
  predicting whether a user of the application will be approved for the loan (and the probability), based on 
  enter their data (i.e. the value of the “features” the model is trained on).
  Effectively, you will be building a supervised machine learning classifier 
  based on the naïve bayes classifier.

(Given theme is -> MachineIsFaulty)

Assignment criteria
• All of your assignment to be written in Java. 
• Your code should demonstrate the use of OO concepts where appropriate (separate classes, 
encapsulation, composition, inheritance , interfaces, etc). 
• Code should follow java code standards
• Use BitBucket or GIT to manage your source code. Your code and video link will be collected from 
your whatever code repository you use (more on this). If you haven’t used GIT, we can cover in 
class. Please make sure you commit to your code source throughout the project. 
• If you make use of any code directly from another source (online, genAI, book), you must show this 
in the comments. You will be marked on code that is your own code
